# CS425/ECE428 Distributed Systems MP1

## Run

The project building is powered by [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/). Make sure you have this by your hand.

- At the root of the project, simply run

  ```bash
  $ ant
  ```

  This will generate a directory named `bin/`. All the compiled byte codes are contained within.

- Move to `bin/`, and Run the **NodeLauncher** with specified port number.

  ```bash
  $ java NodeLauncher [port]
  ```
